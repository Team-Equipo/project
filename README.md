# Vision Statement
For entry-level learners who first encounter a new language abroad, online translators and dictionaries are a double-edged sword; though they may be used to ease the difficulties of immediate communication, repeated usage may hinder long-term language acquisition by disrupting immersion in the target language. Lingucidity is designed to address the immediate needs of basic entry-level communication while shifting the onus of long-term language acquisition onto the user.
​

A portmanteau of “linguistic” and “lucidity,” Lingucidity’s functionality lies in the middle of a spectrum between the immediate but intellectually unengaging practicality of translation software and the intellectually rigorous but abstract approach of long-term language acquisition in apps like Duolingo, which initially focus on grammar and vocabulary not immediately useful to navigating unfamiliar environments. Lingucidity provides two core features: access to a list of essential, practical, pre-translated words and phrases in the target language—which addresses immediate needs left unmet by the long-term approach—and “transparent” translation, a more flexible translation tool that allows users to break down a translation into any subset of constituent parts to examine their alternate translations and grammatical characteristics (tense, conjugation, person, etc.), which enables more critical engagement with the translation and facilitates greater connections between the original and target language than would otherwise be possible in a translator with flat output.
