# Lingucidity: A Lucid In-Context Approach to Linguistic Activity
Lingucidity is a language-oriented utility application that emphasizes interactions over rote study. While language apps like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) target long-term learners with a range of exercises too broad to apply to one’s immediate circumstances, Lingucidity, a portmanteau of “linguistic” and “lucidity,” better addresses the short-term needs of international travel. By providing lists of topically-organized, LLM-generated words and phrases in the target language adapted to the environmental, colloquial, and personal circumstances the user provides, Lingucidity allows users to better apply the language to their immediate needs as international travelers. To further facilitate such linguistic connections, Lingucidity also integrates the [Wordreference](https://wordreference.com/) dictionary into its translation output so users can gain insight into how individual words and phrases are conjugated and translated, which provides more opportunities for inter-linguistic engagement than traditional translators like [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
