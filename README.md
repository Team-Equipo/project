# Vision Statement
When vacationing in foreign countries, many tourists encounter difficulties due to linguistic and cultural barriers. Though some have the luxury of time to learn language and culture through long-term language acquisition apps, the majority are unable to achieve fluency over short-term stays; regardless, some travelers may attempt to learn the language of their destination even while relying on translation apps for necessary communication. Unfortunately, relying heavily on translation apps can impede long-term language acquisition by hindering immersion in the target language, particularly for beginners encountering a new language abroad. Therefore, our aim is to address these challenges by offering a solution that enables travelers to communicate effectively with locals while also considering the importance of long-term language acquisition.

Our app, Lingucidity, is a portmanteau of "linguistic" and "lucidity." Lingucidity fills the sometimes subconscious gap between basic translation apps like [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)—which are utilitarian but intellectually unengaging—and language learning apps like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), which are intellectually rigorous but not immediately practical for navigating unfamiliar environments. To bridge this gap, Lingucidity offers access to a carefully curated list of essential, useful, pre-translated words and phrases in the target language, tailored to the user's needs and accounting for social and cultural context. At the higher level of acquisition, Lingucidity also offers "transparent" translation, a more flexible translation tool that allows users to break down a translation into any subset of constituent parts to examine their alternate translations and grammatical characteristics (tense, conjugation, person, etc.), which enables more critical engagement with the translation and facilitates greater connections between the original and target language than would otherwise be possible in a translator with flat output.
