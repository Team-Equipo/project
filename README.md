# Vision Statement
When vacationing in foreign countries, many tourists encounter difficulties due to language and cultural barriers. While a few may have the luxury of time to devote to learning the language and culture through language acquisition apps, the majority lack the necessary time to achieve fluency. Moreover, some travelers may find inspiration to learn the language of their destination after spending some time there, relying on translation apps for necessary communication. Unfortunately, relying heavily on translation apps can impede long-term language acquisition by hindering immersion in the target language, particularly for beginners encountering a new language abroad. Therefore, our aim is to address these challenges by offering a solution that enables travelers to communicate effectively with locals while also considering the importance of long-term language acquisition.

Our app, Lingucidity, is a portmanteau of "linguistic" and "lucidity". Lingucidity fills the gap between basic translation apps like [Google Translate :registered:](https://translate.google.com) that are immediate but intellectually unengaging and language learning apps like [Duolingo :registered:](https://www.duolingo.com) that are intellectually rigorous but not immediately useful to navigating unfamiliar environments. Lingucidity offers access to a carefully curated list of essential, useful, pre-translated words and phrases in the target language, tailored to the user's needs and taking into consideration the social and cultural context. Lingucidity also offers "transparent" translation, a more flexible translation tool that allows users to break down a translation into any subset of constituent parts to examine their alternate translations and grammatical characteristics (tense, conjugation, person, etc.), which enables more critical engagement with the translation and facilitates greater connections between the original and target language than would otherwise be possible in a translator with flat output.
